**Security Statement**

This project will have three major security concerns: collison, movement, and checkpoints. The main concern with collision is that if collision isn’t properly implemented then the player might fall through or go through an object that they were not meant to. Which could cause them to die unexpectedly or get stuck in an area not intended without a way to die causing a softlock. To mitigate this issue we will employ testing on each of the levels and the objects in the level to ensure that collision is properly implemented in the way we want it to.		The main concern with movement is making sure that the player can’t exploit the movement options in a way that was not intended. For example we do not want the player to be able to continuously build up speed without a cap as it could cause the game to crash or glitch because the game can’t handle the speed the player is moving at. We’ll do this by putting a cap on the maximum positive and negative speed and test to be sure the cap works.	Finally, the main concern for the checkpoints is that they load the player in where they are supposed to. If the player hits a checkpoint then when the player dies the player should respawn at the checkpoint. If the checkpoints don’t work then the player could spawn at a random point or at the beginning of the level.
