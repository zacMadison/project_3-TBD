# Executive Summary
## The Problem
1. We need to create a game, with the purpose of entertaining the end user.
## Process to Solve Problem
1. Determine type of game
    - Genre
    - Mechanics and features
    - Game design style 
2. Problem solving process
    - Because this game is being developed using the incremental design process, each iteration will contain its own plan, design, and implementation phases.
3. Planning
    - Each iteration will begin with a meeting to determine iteration requirements.
4. Documentation and Design
    - Before work begins for the iteration necessary documentation and diagrams will be created.
5. Implementation
    - Programming work for the iteration will be completed.
6. Post-Implementation Documentation
    - Documentation around the function of code will be created.
    - Security and functional requirements documentation will be created.
    - Testing will occur and corresponding documentation will be created.
## Solution
1. Our group intends on creating a simple 2D platformer with basic movement mechanics, multiple levels, and obstacles.
## Deliverables
1. Player character with simple movement mechanics.
   - Can move left and right.
   - Can jump.
   - Can dash in the air.
2. Objects with collision with the player character.
   - Building block of stage design.
3. Multiple stages for the player to complete.
4. Obstacles for the player to avoid.
   - ex. stage hazards, death pits, etc.
5. Powerups for the player to use.
   - ex. bonus air-dashes.
